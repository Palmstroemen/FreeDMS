# FreeDMS
A structured way to organize your data in standardized folders. 
This makes folder structures machine readable and makes it easy to exchange your projects with others.

  * For getting the idea, please read the document [Motivation and Introduction.md](/blob/master/Motivation%20and%20Introduction.md) first.
  * To try it, go to the installPackages folder, download the freeDMS.tar and follow the instructions in the READ.me file.
  * For an idea of the technique please refer to [Technical intro.md](../Technical intro.md).
  * Find the current structure inside the Templates-Folder.
